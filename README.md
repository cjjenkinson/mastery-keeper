  <h3>Mastery Keeper</h3>
  <h5>Daily reports on your progress towards 10,000 hours of skill mastery ðŸŽ©</h5>

### What is Mastery Keeper?

Mastery Keeper is a personal reporting app that keeps you focused on a long term path of skill mastery.

Mastery Keeper tracks the total amount of hours practiced towards a goal such as 10,000 hours of programming.

Mastery Keeper will use the time logs from Rescue Time a service which automatically tracks time spent on specific activities like Software Engineering meaning all logs are accurate and reliable.

Every morning your Keeper will head out and get the logs from the day before and will create some useful insights on your progress before packaging it all up in a report sent to you via email.

The daily progress report looks like this:

### How to deploy your own Keeper

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjjenkinson/masterykeeper.git
```

Then follow these three steps:

1. Create a personal Rescue Time API key
2. Define settings in now-secrets.json file
3. Deploy with now

#### 1. Rescue Time API Key

https://www.rescuetime.com/anapi/manage

#### 2. Define Keeper settings

Timezone: http://momentjs.com/timezone/

#### 3. Deploy with now

In the root of the directory

```bash
now
```

Copy the deployed URL and run the now scale command

```bash
now scale https://my-app-replacethis.now.sh 1
```

This creates an instance that ensures the Cron Job will always execute.

An important note:

Since weâ€™re forcing it to keep each instance alive you need to manually delete old instances after new deploys using the ```now rm``` command. You can see a list of all instances using ```now ls```.
