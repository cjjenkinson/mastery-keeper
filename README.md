# Mastery Keeper

Daily reports on your progress towards 10,000 hours of skill mastery ðŸŽ©

### What is Mastery Keeper?

Mastery Keeper is a personal reporting app that keeps you focused on a long term path of mastery of a particular skill. Mastery in the scope of Mastery Keeper is a the total amount of hours spent on a particular activity that is tracked using a time tracking service such as Rescue Time. Every day it will collect the daily summary from the previous day and email the user a report on how they're doing.

The report looks like this:

</div>

### Why?

10,000 hours is well known to be the amount of hours needed to master a particular skill.

Every morning Mastery Keeper sends me a reminder that helps me focus and hold me accountable to consistently practice to become a better software engineer than I was yesterday.

Although I may not become a master at 10,000 hours I am pretty certain that I'll be better than I was at 1,000, 5,000 hours and so on. Mastery Keeper was created because I am pretty lazy at keeping track of the total amount of hours I spend doing things like programming. I've tried doing it manually but I was not able to do it consistently and reliably.

It dawned on me that I use Rescue Time to track what I do when I'm using my laptop both at work and at home. Any activity related to software engineering is automatically tracked through Rescue Time and it is a great way to measure hours practiced without thinking about it. Mastery Keeper was made to be an extension to these time tracking services and it uses the logs to provide a personalised goal progress tool.
