# Mastery Keeper

Daily reports on your progress towards 10,000 hours of skill mastery ðŸŽ©

### What is Mastery Keeper?

Mastery Keeper is a personal reporting app that keeps you focused on a long term path of mastery of a particular skill. 

Mastery in the scope of Mastery Keeper is a the total amount of hours spent on a particular activity that is tracked using a time tracking service such as Rescue Time. Every day it will collect the daily summary from the previous day and email the user a report on how they're doing.

The report looks like this:
